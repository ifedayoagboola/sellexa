# Cultural Storefront - Content Cleanup Summary

## âœ… Completed Cleanup

### 1. **Removed Dummy/Mock Data**

- **Social Stats**: Replaced random generated stats with real data structure
  - `followers`: Now shows 0 (will be fetched from database)
  - `reviews`: Now shows 0 (will be fetched from database)
  - `rating`: Now shows "0.0" (will be fetched from database)
  - `returningBuyers`: Now shows 0 (will be fetched from database)
  - `totalSales`: Now uses actual `productCount` from props

### 2. **Updated Video Sections**

- **Before**: Interactive video player with play/pause/mute controls
- **After**: Clear "Coming Soon" placeholder with explanation
- **Message**: "Video Story Coming Soon - Sellers will be able to upload intro videos"

### 3. **Cleaned Up Hardcoded Statistics**

- **Before**: "10K+ Buyers", "10,000+ Active Buyers", "100% Verified Sellers", "24/7 Customer Support"
- **After**: Generic labels like "Active Buyers", "Verified Sellers", "Customer Support"

### 4. **Improved Zero-Value Handling**

- **Rating**: Shows "New" instead of "0.0/5" for new sellers
- **Followers**: Shows "New Seller" instead of "0 followers"
- **Reviews**: Shows "No reviews yet" instead of "0 reviews"
- **Returning Buyers**: Shows "New" instead of "0 returning buyers"

### 5. **Fixed Location Display**

- **Before**: Always showed "Location not specified" when seller.city was null
- **After**: Business-first fallback chain: `kycData.business_city` â†’ `kycData.business_country` â†’ `seller.city` â†’ "Location not specified"
- **Result**: Prioritizes business location over personal location for business pages

### 6. **Removed Unused Code**

- Removed unused state variables: `isVideoPlaying`, `isMuted`
- Removed unused imports: `Pause`, `Volume2`, `VolumeX`, `Eye`, `ThumbsUp`, `StarIcon`, `Calendar`, `Flag`
- Cleaned up video control functions
