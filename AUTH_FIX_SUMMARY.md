# ✅ Authentication Issues - FIXED

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ❌ Localhost Redirect After Email Verification

**Problem:** Users clicking email verification links were redirected to `localhost` instead of `sellexa.app/feed`

**Solution:**

- ✅ Created auth callback route: `src/app/auth/callback/route.ts`
- ✅ Added `emailRedirectTo` parameter in signup function
- ⚠️ **Requires Supabase dashboard configuration** (see below)

---

### 2. ❌ Wrong Error Message for Existing Accounts

**Problem:** Trying to signup with existing email showed "check your email" instead of "account already exists"

**Solution:**

- ✅ Added duplicate email detection by checking if `identities` array is empty
- ✅ Now shows: "An account with this email already exists. Please sign in instead."

---

## 🚨 REQUIRED: Supabase Dashboard Setup

You **MUST** configure these settings in Supabase for the fix to work:

### Go To:

https://app.supabase.com/project/sxveqitmcfrhmagycahx/auth/url-configuration

### Configure These Settings:

1. **Site URL:** `https://sellexa.app`

2. **Redirect URLs:** (add both)
   ```
   https://sellexa.app/auth/callback
   https://sellexa.app/**
   ```

---

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Make sure your production environment has:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://sellexa.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://sxveqitmcfrhmagycahx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```
