## 🚀 How to Apply

### **Step 1: Test Locally (Development)**

```bash
# Switch to develop branch
git checkout develop

# Add the new files
git add supabase/migrations/20251007000000_add_comprehensive_rls_policies.sql
git add docs/RLS_SECURITY_GUIDE.md
git add docs/RLS_SETUP_SUMMARY.md
git add scripts/test-rls.js
git add package.json
git add next.config.js

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Add comprehensive RLS policies for database security"

# Push to develop
git push origin develop

# Link to dev Supabase
npm run db:link:dev

# Apply RLS migration
npm run migrate:dev

# Test RLS policies
npm run test:rls

# Start your app and test features
npm run dev
```

### **Step 2: Verify Everything Works**

Test these features in your app:

- ✅ View products (should work)
- ✅ Create product as verified seller (should work)
- ✅ Create product as unverified user (should fail)
- ✅ View your own profile (should work)
- ✅ Edit someone else's profile (should fail)
- ✅ Send messages in your conversations (should work)
- ✅ View other people's conversations (should fail)

### **Step 3: Deploy to Production**

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge from develop
git merge develop

# Push to main
git push origin main

# Link to production
npm run db:link:prod

# Apply RLS migration to production
npm run migrate:prod

# Test RLS in production
npm run test:rls

# Verify production app works correctly
```

## 📊 What This Protects

### **Before RLS:**

❌ Any authenticated user could read ALL products  
❌ Users could view other people's conversations  
❌ Unverified users could create products  
❌ Users could modify other people's data  
❌ Private information was accessible via API

### **After RLS:**

✅ Users only see their own private data  
✅ Only verified sellers can create products  
✅ Conversations are private to participants  
✅ Database enforces security automatically  
✅ Even malicious code can't bypass protections

---

## 🧪 Testing RLS

Run the automated test suite:

```bash
npm run test:rls
```

**Expected output:**

```

## 🔑 Key Security Policies

### **Products**

- ✅ Public products visible to all
- ✅ Draft products only visible to owner
- ✅ Only verified sellers can create products
- ✅ Owners can edit/delete their products

### **Conversations (Threads & Messages)**

- ✅ Only participants can view conversations
- ✅ Only participants can send messages
- ✅ No one can access other people's chats

### **Profiles**

- ✅ All profiles are public (for seller transparency)
- ✅ Users can only edit their own profile
- ✅ Profile deletion blocked (must delete account via auth)

### **KYC Documents**

- ✅ Highly sensitive - only owner can view
- ✅ Admins use service role key (bypasses RLS)
- ✅ Never exposed to other users

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **Service Role Key Security**

The service role key **bypasses all RLS policies**. It should:

- ✅ Only be used in server-side code
- ✅ Never be exposed to the client
- ✅ Be kept in environment variables
- ✅ Only be used for admin operations

### **Testing in Development**

- Always test RLS changes in dev first
- Use the automated test suite
- Manually test all major features
- Verify nothing breaks

### **Production Deployment**

- Apply migrations during low-traffic periods
- Monitor for any access errors
- Have rollback plan ready
- Test immediately after deployment

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **"Permission denied" errors after applying RLS**

**Possible causes:**

1. User not authenticated
2. User doesn't have required status (e.g., KYC not verified)
3. Policy is too restrictive

**Solutions:**

```javascript
// Check user authentication
const {
  data: { user },
} = await supabase.auth.getUser();
console.log("User:", user);

// Check user's KYC status
const { data: profile } = await supabase
  .from("profiles")
  .select("kyc_status")
  .eq("id", user.id)
  .single();
console.log("KYC Status:", profile.kyc_status);
```

### **Can't create products as seller**

Make sure the user's KYC status is 'verified':

```sql
-- Check in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT id, name, kyc_status FROM profiles WHERE id = 'user-id-here';

-- Update if needed (dev only)
UPDATE profiles SET kyc_status = 'verified' WHERE id = 'user-id-here';
```

### **RLS tests failing**

1. Make sure migration was applied: `npm run db:status`
2. Check Supabase logs for errors
3. Verify environment variables are correct
4. Test with a fresh database reset (dev only): `npm run db:reset`

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

Your RLS implementation is successful when:

- [x] Migration applies without errors
- [x] All RLS tests pass (`npm run test:rls`)
- [x] Verified sellers can create products
- [x] Unverified users cannot create products
- [x] Users can only view their own conversations
- [x] Users can only edit their own data
- [x] All app features work correctly
- [x] No security warnings in Supabase dashboard

---

## 🎉 Benefits

With RLS enabled, you now have:

✅ **Defense in depth** - Security at the database level  
✅ **Automatic enforcement** - Can't be bypassed by client code  
✅ **Data privacy** - Users can't access others' private data  
✅ **Audit trail** - Supabase logs all policy violations  
✅ **Peace of mind** - Industry-standard security practices  
✅ **Production ready** - Safe to handle real user data
